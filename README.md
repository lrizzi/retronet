# XenT RetroNet

This is a really convoluted and inefficent way to build an ISDN network using Cisco devices not really designed to be a Telephone switch, but anyway it kind of works, the entire network it's connected via TDM to OCTOI (Osmocom Community TDM over IP) and via IAX to C*NET (The Collectors' Net) so it's reacheable and consistent.

Here you can fine the Dial Plan [here](dial-plan.txt)

There also a PSTN gateway if interested let me know.
